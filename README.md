# üì∞ Kodia News Portal Challenge

Welcome to the Kodia News Portal challenge! This project is designed to evaluate your skills in building modern web applications using Next.js and working with headless CMS systems. The goal is to create a news portal that showcases your ability to work with real-world technologies and implement best practices in web development.

## üéØ Project Overview

You'll be building a news portal that allows users to browse and read articles. The project is built with Next.js and uses Sanity as its headless CMS. While the basic structure is in place, there are several areas where your expertise and creativity can shine.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **CMS**: Sanity
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## üöÄ Challenge Focus

This challenge is designed to evaluate your ability to:

1. Work with modern Next.js features and best practices
2. Implement efficient data fetching and state management
3. Create a responsive and accessible user interface
4. Integrate with a headless CMS
5. Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code

While the project comes with TailwindCSS pre-configured, you have complete freedom to use any component library of your choice.

> [!NOTE]
> As the project advances, you'll notice the lack of sample data to display. It is up to you to create and/or mock any data that you need or want to show. This will be part of an important requirement over on the [success criteria](#-success-criteria).

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your solution should be a well-structured, performant news portal that handles data efficiently and provides a smooth user experience. The code should be clean, properly documented, and follow Next.js conventions. Pay attention to error handling, responsive design, and accessibility standards.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As part of the delivery process, make sure to deploy your project to whatever platform you choose (e.g. Vercel, Netlify). A simple live link for us to test you application, along with the code to review it, will be enough.

## üí° Key Areas to Explore

This challenge focuses on your ability to work with Next.js App Router, server and client components, and Sanity CMS. You should demonstrate practical knowledge of data fetching, TypeScript implementation, and performance optimization. A good understanding of SEO principles is also expected.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone/fork the repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the required environment variables (see [SANITY.md](./docs/SANITY.md))
4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   - Both `predev` and `prebuild` commands run the schema extraction for [Sanity's type generation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/apis-and-sdks/sanity-typegen)

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

As this is a real-world simulation, we expect you to follow professional development practices:

1. Create a new branch for each feature or fix
2. Write clear, descriptive commit messages
3. Submit pull requests with:
   - A concise title that describes the change
   - A detailed description of what was implemented
   - Screenshots for UI changes (optional)

## ü§ñ AI Tools & Usage Guidelines

The use of AI-integrated development tools (such as Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or any other code completion/LLM tools) is strictly prohibited for this challenge, as the purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your personal coding abilities and problem-solving skills.

However, you are allowed to use AI tools for auxiliary purposes such as:

- Generating mock data for the CMS
- Creating placeholder images or profile pictures
- Generating content for testing purposes

These tools should only be used as support for non-coding tasks and should not influence the actual implementation of the solution.

> [!CAUTION]
> Submissions that show evidence of using these tools will be rejected.

## ‚è± Time Frame

The challenge should be completed within a reasonable timeframe. Focus on delivering a working solution that demonstrates your skills and understanding of the technologies involved.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your implementation!
